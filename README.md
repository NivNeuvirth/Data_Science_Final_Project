# Data Science Final Project - H.I.T

## About 
As part of my studies I participated in a data science course, where I made a final project.
The project is about beer - what makes it great and is it possible to predict the rating of a specific beer.
I collected data about thousands of different beers, and used the data with the knowledge I got from the course to try and answer the research question.
